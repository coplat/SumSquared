# Summing Up Squares!

This Rust project exposes a function, `summing_up_squares`, that calculates the sum of squares from 1 to a given number `n` to JavaScript via WebAssembly (WASM).

## Features

- **Sum of Squares Calculation**: The function `summing_up_squares` computes the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- **JavaScript Interoperability**: Using [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/), this function is accessible from JavaScript.
